# CyclonePhysicsEngine
C# port of the [Cylcone physics engine](https://github.com/idmillington/cyclone-physics/blob/master/LICENSE) based on the book Game Physics Engine Design.

I have made some small changes and restructured the code a little.

The projects uses Unity to create a few test scenes but the code (all the scripts in the Cyclone folder) is not connected to Unity in any way and can be used as a standonle project if required.
